# SendToFuture

SendToFuture is a SwiftUI implementation of an app that allows users to send URLs to the future via a notification. Users use the Share menu to add a URL to the list, and the notification is sent in 8 hours. Currently, this time is not adjustable, but is a todo.

The progress of the app can be monitored using the Project board.
